# fertitta's FlyPT Stuff

I've decided to start archiving my FlyPT mover profiles to github so that I can freely make changes and still be able to revert to previous versions of the profiles if needed.  Also I believe it helps facilitate sharing.

# My Rig #

I am using a linear 3 DOF rig with a Traction Loss platform and seat belt tension system.  My actuators are PT Actuator Mega Monsters with 150mm stroke, the belt tension design is from flag ghost.  The system is controlled via a Thanos controller with axis1-4 being my linear actuators, 5 is the TL actuator, and 6 controls the seat belts.
