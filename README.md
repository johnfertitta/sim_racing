Profiles for multiple cars for the DD1 and DD2, they are matched by "specific output" as defined by Brion Sohn [here](https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3648546.page)  These profiles were originally made by [Maurice BÃ¶schen on iRacing forums](https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/250/3648546.page#11745131)

# Rig

![Picture of my rig](/rig_picture.jpg?raw=true)

3D model of my rig design. It's changed a bit since then, maybe I'll udpate it eventually. BOM can be found [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/simracing/comments/9jesns/custom_8020_rig_question/e6r52vm/).  Open the model with MAY-CAD

I am using a linear 3 DOF rig with a Traction Loss platform and seat belt tension system.  My actuators are PT Actuator Mega Monsters with 150mm stroke, the belt tension design is from flag ghost.  The system is controlled via a Thanos controller with axis1-4 being my linear actuators, 5 is the TL actuator, and 6 controls the seat belts.
