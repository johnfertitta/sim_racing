# iRacing profile

This profile was tuned mostly for the Audi R8, but I've found works reasonably well with most cars.  It emphasises sway and surge. Surge is heavily smoothed to reduce the "kick" from shifting.

I run these profiles with a filter factor of 2 (semi-hard) and a spike filter level of 2500 on the AMC-AASD15A controller.
